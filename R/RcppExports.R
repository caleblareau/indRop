#' Calculate k Nearest Neighbors from Pearson distance metric
#'
#' Each distance metric has its own function for speed/efficiency
#' This takes a sample X feature matrix and returns
#' a matrix of k nearest neighbors. This is the one for Pearson.

#' @param x An m x n numeric matrix
#' @param k The number of nearest neighbors to return
#' per sample
#' @return An m x k matrix of indicies 1...k of the
#' nearest neighbors for the specified row based on
#' Pearson distance.
